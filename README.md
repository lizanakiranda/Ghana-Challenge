# Ghana-Challenge
The Ghana’s Indigenous Intel Challenge from Zindi
I participated in this Zindi Challenge to practise building a classification model.

The goal of this challenge was to build a classification model that predicts the type of rainfall—heavy, moderate, or small—expected in the next 12 to 24 hours, based solely on indigenous ecological indicators submitted by trained farmers.

The decission tree model was my best model and its what i rolled out

Feel free to share comments that will make my model better
